Aim:
    To master nested loops and conditional logic.
    To develop problem-solving skills for generating structured output.
    To understand basic character and number manipulation.
    
Theory:
    Nested Loops: Outer loop for rows, inner loop for columns.
    Conditional Logic: if-else statements to control what's printed (star, space, character) based on position or condition.
    Dynamic Limits: Inner loop iterations often depend on the outer loop's current value.
    
Conclusion:
    Excellent for building foundational programming logic and debugging skills.
    Demonstrates how simple constructs create complex visual results.
    Essential for grasping program flow and iterative control.
