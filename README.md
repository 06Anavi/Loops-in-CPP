🎯 AIM

To explore the use of for, while, and do while loops in C++ for automating repetitive tasks, implementing algorithms, and optimizing control flow in applications.
📚 THEORY

Loops in C++ are control flow structures that allow repeated execution of a block of code. They are fundamental in programming for:

    Automating repetitive tasks
    Iterating over data structures
    Implementing algorithms efficiently
    Enhancing code modularity and readability

🔄 Types of Loops in C++

1. For Loop

Used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.
Combines initialization, condition check, and increment or decrement in a single line.
Ideal for counting loops, array traversal, and fixed iteration tasks.

2. While Loop

Used when the number of iterations is unknown.
Condition is checked before each iteration.
Suitable for condition-driven logic such as waiting for user input or sensor data.

3. Do While Loop

Executes the loop body at least once before checking the condition.
Useful in scenarios like menu-driven programs or input validation where the loop must run at least once.
🧭 Loop Control Statements
Break
Terminates the loop immediately when a specific condition is met.
Commonly used in search operations or early exits.

Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next.
Helps avoid deeply nested conditions and improves clarity.

🔁 Nested Loops

Nested loops are loops placed inside other loops. They are essential for:

    Generating patterns such as triangles or grids
    Traversing multi-dimensional arrays or matrices
    Creating structured outputs like multiplication tables

In nested loops, the inner loop completes its full cycle for each iteration of the outer loop.

🧠 Common Loop-Based Algorithms-

Factorial Calculation

Multiplies all positive integers up to a given number.
Used in combinatorics and mathematical computations.

Fibonacci Sequence

Each term is the sum of the two preceding ones.
Applied in algorithm design and modeling growth patterns.

Prime Number Check

Determines if a number has no divisors other than one and itself.
Crucial in cryptography and number theory.

Sum of Natural Numbers

Adds numbers sequentially from one to N.
Demonstrates basic iterative accumulation.

Pattern Generation

Uses nested loops to print visual structures.
Enhances understanding of loop flow and indexing.
